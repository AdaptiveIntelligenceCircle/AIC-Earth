# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct exists to protect the integrity of reasoning,
not to enforce ideological alignment or social comfort.

AIC welcomes disagreement, critique, and discomfort —
as long as they are grounded in good faith and intellectual honesty.

---

## Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:
- Argue ideas, not attack persons
- Provide reasoning, not slogans
- Accept uncertainty and revision
- Respect architectural constraints, even if they disagree with them

Strong opinions are allowed.
Careless power claims are not.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not acceptable:
- Advocating irreversible control over humans or societies
- Introducing hidden authority, enforcement, or surveillance paths
- Using AIC as a vehicle for ideological dominance
- Deliberate obfuscation of system power or intent
- Treating human override or rollback as "inefficiency"

Harassment is unacceptable — but so is intellectual dishonesty.

---

## No Ideological Neutrality Theater

AIC does not enforce:
- Political correctness
- Moral grandstanding
- Performative inclusion

What matters is:
- Clarity
- Accountability
- Architectural responsibility

---

## Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- Rejection of contributions
- Revocation of participation rights
- Permanent exclusion in severe cases

There is no appeal to popularity or authority.
Decisions are made to preserve system integrity.

---

## Final Principle

Participation in AIC is a responsibility, not an entitlement.

If you are uncomfortable with restraint, limits, or rollback —
this may not be the right project for you.
