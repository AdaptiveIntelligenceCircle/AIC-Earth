# AIC-Earth Core

The Core of AIC-Earth defines the **non-negotiable foundations**
that govern how the system behaves, fails, and corrects itself.

Core is not an optimization engine.
Core exists to **constrain intelligence**, not amplify it.

---

## Purpose of the Core

The Core ensures that:
- No decision becomes irreversible by accident
- No agent accumulates unchecked authority
- No intelligence operates without trust constraints
- Failure results in learning, not collapse

The Core is intentionally conservative.

---

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Policy Enforcement
The Core defines and enforces system-level policies such as:
- escalation limits
- autonomy constraints
- human override requirements

Policies are evaluated continuously, not only at decision time.

---

### 2. Rollback Authority
Rollback is a **first-class capability**, not an exception handler.

The Core must be able to:
- suspend decisions
- revert system state
- invalidate trust relationships
- trigger re-simulation

Rollback is triggered by:
- instability metrics
- trust erosion
- human escalation
- ethical violations

---

### 3. Trust Management
Trust in AIC-Earth is:
- dynamic
- contextual
- revocable

The Core does not assume trust.
It measures, degrades, and restores trust explicitly.

Loss of trust always outweighs gains in performance.

---

### 4. Power Limitation
The Core actively resists:
- centralization
- permanent authority
- opaque escalation paths

No component, agent, or process is allowed to become irreplaceable.

---

## What the Core Does NOT Do

- It does not predict the future
- It does not optimize outcomes
- It does not automate governance
- It does not decide what is “good”

The Core only decides what is **unsafe to continue**.

---

## Design Philosophy

> If the Core fails, the system must slow down — not speed up.

Silence, uncertainty, and hesitation are acceptable states.
Unchecked confidence is not.

---

## Relationship to Other Layers

- Simulation feeds the Core with evidence
- Observability exposes the Core’s decisions to humans
- Humans retain the final authority over Core outcomes

The Core never bypasses humans.
