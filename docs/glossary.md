# AIC-Earth Glossary

This glossary defines terms as they are used **specifically within AIC-Earth**.
Common meanings outside this project may differ.

---

## AIC (Adaptive Intelligence Commons)
A collective, open, non-proprietary effort to build adaptive intelligence systems
that prioritize trust, reversibility, and human dignity over optimization or power.

---

## AIC-Earth
A conceptual and architectural layer that treats Earth as a distributed,
socio-technical-intelligence system, not as a resource to be optimized.

---

## Agent
Any entity capable of making decisions and influencing the system.
This includes humans, organizations, AI systems, and institutions.

---

## Sandbox
A controlled simulation space used to test decisions, policies, or behaviors
without affecting real-world systems.

Sandboxes in AIC-Earth are **ethics-first**, not deployment pipelines.

---

## Replay
A mechanism to reconstruct and examine past decision chains,
including alternative outcomes (counterfactuals).

Replay exists to enable accountability and rollback, not surveillance.

---

## Rollback
The ability to reverse or suspend decisions, policies, or system states
when harm, instability, or loss of trust is detected.

Rollback is a **right**, not a failure.

---

## Trust
A dynamic, measurable, and revocable relationship between agents.
Trust is never assumed, never permanent, and never absolute.

---

## Observability
The right and capability of humans to understand what the system is doing,
why it is doing it, and what consequences may follow.

---

## Human-in-the-loop
A mandatory design constraint where humans retain the ability to intervene,
veto, or halt system behavior.

---

## Earth Metrics
Indicators of systemic stability, trust, fragility, and adaptability
at large scales. These are **not KPIs** and are not optimization targets.

---

## Signal
Early, uncertain indicators of stress, anomaly, or erosion of trust.
Signals trigger investigation, not automatic action.
