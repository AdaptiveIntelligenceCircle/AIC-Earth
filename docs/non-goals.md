# Non-Goals of AIC-Earth

AIC-Earth is intentionally limited.
The following are explicit non-goals.

---

## Not a Global Control System
AIC-Earth does not aim to control, govern, or optimize the planet.

There is no central authority, no global dashboard, and no master algorithm.

---

## Not Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
AIC-Earth is not an attempt to create AGI or superintelligence.

Intelligence is treated as contextual, constrained, and fallible.

---

## Not Automation of Governance
AIC-Earth does not replace political, legal, or social decision-making.

Human institutions remain responsible for outcomes.

---

## Not a Surveillance Platform
AIC-Earth does not seek to monitor individuals, populations, or nations.

Replay and observability exist for accountability, not control.

---

## Not Optimization for Growth or Efficiency
Economic growth, efficiency, or performance maximization are not objectives.

Stability, reversibility, and trust take precedence over speed or scale.

---

## Not Neutral by Default
AIC-Earth does not claim value-neutrality.

It explicitly prioritizes:
- human dignity
- reversibility
- resistance to concentration of power

---

## Not a Commercial Product
AIC-Earth is not designed to be monetized, enclosed, or proprietary.

Any use that undermines its core principles is incompatible.
