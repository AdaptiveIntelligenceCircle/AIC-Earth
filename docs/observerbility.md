# Observability in AIC-Earth

Observability in AIC-Earth is not monitoring.
It is the **right to understand and contest system behavior**.

If a human cannot understand what is happening,
the system must not proceed.

## Purpose of Observability

Observability exists to:
- prevent silent harm
- expose power dynamics
- enable accountability
- preserve human agency

It is designed for **scrutiny**, not comfort.

---

## Two Levels of Observability

### 1. Human Observability
Focused on individual and collective human understanding.

Provides:
- explanations of decisions
- expression of disagreement
- trust signals
- escalation requests

Human observability explicitly forbids:
- persuasive framing
- emotional manipulation
- confidence theater

---

### 2. Earth Observability
Focused on systemic health at scale.

Includes:
- stability metrics
- trust indices
- early warning signals
- post-incident reports

Earth observability does not issue commands.
It only informs and warns.

---

## Signals vs Metrics vs Reports

- **Signals** are early, uncertain indicators
- **Metrics** quantify system conditions
- **Reports** document outcomes and lessons

These layers are intentionally separated
to prevent premature or automated action.

---

## Observability Constraints

- Observability must not become surveillance
- Observability must not drive optimization
- Observability must not replace judgment

Visibility without restraint is dangerous.

---

## Human Authority

Humans have the right to:
- request explanations
- challenge decisions
- demand rollback
- halt system behavior

No observability layer is considered complete
without a human escalation path.

---

## Design Principle

> Observability is a safeguard, not a steering wheel.

It reveals.
It does not rule.
