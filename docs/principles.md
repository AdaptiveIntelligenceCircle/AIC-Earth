# Principles of AIC-Earth

These principles guide architecture, implementation, and governance.

They are not optional.

---

## 1. Trust Before Intelligence
Systems must establish and maintain trust before demonstrating intelligence.

Loss of trust outweighs gains in performance.

---

## 2. Reversibility by Design
Every meaningful decision must be reversible or suspendable.

Irreversible systems are considered unsafe.

---

## 3. No Single Point of Power
Architectures must resist centralization, monopoly, and unilateral control.

Power concentration is treated as a systemic risk.

---

## 4. Human Comprehensibility
If humans cannot understand a system’s behavior,
the system must not proceed.

Explainability is a right, not a feature.

---

## 5. Sandbox Before Reality
No policy, behavior, or large-scale decision
may bypass simulation and sandbox testing.

---

## 6. Observability Without Manipulation
Systems must explain without persuading.

Dark patterns, emotional nudging, or coercive framing are forbidden.

---

## 7. Failure is Inevitable, Collapse is Not
Failure is expected and planned for.

Collapse occurs only when rollback, observability, and intervention are absent.

---

## 8. Anti-Empire Architecture
AIC-Earth must not be usable as infrastructure for domination,
colonialism, or technological imperialism.

---

## 9. Humans Retain Final Authority
Human veto and intervention are always possible.

Automation never overrides moral responsibility.

---

## 10. Open by Default, Dangerous by Constraint
Transparency is the default.

Capabilities that pose systemic risk are constrained, not hidden.
