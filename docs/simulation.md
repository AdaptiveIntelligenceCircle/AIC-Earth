# Simulation in AIC-Earth

Simulation is the moral testing ground of AIC-Earth.

Nothing of consequence is allowed to touch reality
without first passing through simulation.

---

## Purpose of Simulation

Simulation exists to:
- test decisions before harm occurs
- explore unintended consequences
- expose power imbalances
- evaluate trust degradation

Simulation is not prediction.
It is **risk discovery**.

---

## Core Simulation Components

### 1. Sandbox
A controlled environment for testing:
- policies
- agent behaviors
- social interactions
- escalation scenarios

Sandbox results are never auto-deployed.

---

### 2. Replay
Replay reconstructs decision timelines to:
- understand how outcomes emerged
- evaluate alternative paths
- support rollback justification

Replay is retrospective and reflective,
not corrective by itself.

---

### 3. Scale Simulation
Explores how local decisions behave when:
- repeated
- amplified
- adopted by many agents

Scale simulation exists to detect
systemic fragility early.

---

### 4. Cognitive and Social Simulation
Models how beliefs, incentives, and narratives evolve.

These simulations explicitly assume:
- irrational behavior
- bias
- manipulation attempts

Rational-agent assumptions are insufficient.

---

## Simulation Boundaries

Simulation results:
- inform the Core
- feed Observability
- require human interpretation

Simulation never authorizes action on its own.

---

## Failure Handling

Simulation failure is expected.

Failure must result in:
- documentation
- replay analysis
- policy adjustment

Failure must never be hidden.

---

## Design Principle

> If a decision cannot survive simulation,
> it has no right to exist in reality.
