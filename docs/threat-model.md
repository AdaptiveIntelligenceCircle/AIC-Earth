# AIC-Earth Threat Model

This document outlines credible threats to AIC-Earth
and the assumptions made in its design.

---

## Threat Category 1: Centralization of Power

### Description
Actors attempt to control or dominate AIC-Earth infrastructure,
standards, or narratives.

### Mitigations
- Decentralized architecture
- No privileged nodes
- No mandatory coordination authority

## Threat Category 2: Ethical Drift

### Description
Gradual erosion of principles under pressure for efficiency,
profit, or political alignment.

### Mitigations
- Explicit non-goals
- Mandatory rollback paths
- Public documentation of decisions

---

## Threat Category 3: Manipulative Use of Observability

### Description
Using explanations to influence, persuade, or coerce humans.

### Mitigations
- Human observability layer forbids persuasive framing
- Signals and metrics separated from decision authority

---

## Threat Category 4: Surveillance Abuse

### Description
Replay and signals repurposed for tracking or monitoring populations.

### Mitigations
- No individual-level tracking by default
- Replay tied to events, not identities
- Human audit requirements

## Threat Category 5: Automated Escalation

### Description
Systems triggering large-scale actions without human review.

### Mitigations
- Sandbox guardrails
- Human-in-the-loop escalation
- Hard stops on autonomy

## Threat Category 6: Misinterpretation as Governance Tool

### Description
AIC-Earth framed as a replacement for political or legal systems.

### Mitigations
- Explicit non-goals
- Clear documentation boundaries
- Design refusal to automate authority

## Assumptions

- Humans are fallible and sometimes irrational
- Power seeks to concentrate
- Transparency alone is insufficient without constraint
- Technical safeguards must be paired with social ones
